# dev_sd

This repository contains a collection of Verilog files used for the design of an SD (Secure Digital) card interface. These files are part of a development project aimed at creating or testing SD card functionalities for FPGA or ASIC implementations. Below is an overview of the key components within this project:

## selected Verilog Source Files

- `dev_sd_box.v`: Top module that integrates the SD card interface components.
- `sd_rbus_if.v`: RingNet interface module for the top SD module. Incorporates FIFOs for clock domains transition
